# Space Maniacs
This project is an educational Android mobile application on international space missions developed for an Android Mobile Development class in the iSchool at the University of Washington. Data is pulled from the [Launch Library 2 API by the Spacedevs](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi). The app displays a filter for upcoming space events, a countdown clock for the next launch mission anywhere in the world, and has ability for users to view and favorite specific astronauts of their choice.
